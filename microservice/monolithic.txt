Good

1, Simple to develop - the goal of current development tools and IDEs is to support the development of monolithic applications
2, Simple to deploy - you simply need to deploy the WAR file (or directory hierarchy) on the appropriate runtime
3, Simple to scale - you can scale the application by running multiple copies of the application behind a load balancer

Bad:
1, Not easy to learn whole application
2, Continuous deployment is difficult
3, Scaling the application can be difficult
