Theological:

1, Hexagonal architecture is a model of designing software applications around domain logic to isolate it from external factors.
2, In a hexagonal architecture, this service is an adapter that implements the port
3, Hexagonal architecture defines the inside and the outside part.
4, Application layer is responsible for orchestrating the execution of domain logic


our application into three layers;
1, domain      ===================> core
2, application ===================> be called
3, Adapters    ===================> basic connect



Compare to DDD
1, Domain
2, Application
3, Presentation
4, Instructure


洋葱架构 = 六边形（Hexagonal）架构
