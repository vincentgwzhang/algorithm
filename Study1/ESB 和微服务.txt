什么是 ESB
ESBs establish data connections between monolithic applications. 
ESBs focus on connecting the monolithic applications that serve an enterprise – and each of these applications performs a variety of services. 

什么是 Microservice
is an approach to building applications that focuses on breaking down monolithic applications into independent,but loosely-connected “microservices.”  
is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP resource API.



比较
Microservice: 
1) more scalable, because Since each feature or service of a microservice architecture is self-contained and autonomous
2) Platform and language flexibility
3) reliability, less chance that the failure of one service will result in the failure of the entire ecosystem
4) Data security and compliance (because data could be put in different place)
5) Independent teams can develop each microservice
6) Contained complexity
7) Deploy faster with CI / CD enviornment



==============+++++++++++++++==============+++++++++++++++==============+++++++++++++++==============+++++++++++++++
选 ESB 或者 Microservice 的标准
depends on how large and diverse the new application environment. 


Larger, more diverse environments choose ESB solution, 
whereas Smaller environments, including web and mobile applications, would choose microservices architecture.

1. Http
2. Messaging
3. event-driven pattern

ESB 的好处
1, Supports different transport protocols like HTTP/S, AMQP, MQTT 
2, Services can be used by any other service regardless of the limitation of networks and technologies 
3, Govern service provides the monitoring and statistics of the services
4, Loosely coupling end services and therefore those can be independently updated without affecting other services
5, Service failures and recovery procedures can be handled 
6, Deployments using CI/CD pipelines

ESB 的坏处
1, Adding additional step/call in the service flow and add a slight delay to the response time. 
2, Additional cost to setup ESB servers, VPNs, and other infrastructure
3, All services are routed through a single place; it will have a single point of failure. 
4, Not having options to scale up a single service in ESB infrastructure.

Microservice 的好处
1, Services are Self-contained and can be scaled independently without effecting other services
2, Built using different technologies and deployed in different platforms as long as communication can be established between each service
3, Business does not require to wait until all teams are complete their developed and Deployment of the microservices.
4, Development and Deployment involve comprehensive CI/CD implementation, and therefore, releases can be planned and executed in parallel.

Microservice 的坏处
1, Microservices heavily use features of cloud-based container services to get the maximum advantage of scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance
2, Microservices application success entirely depends on the network communication between them.
3, Difficult to handle scenarios like transaction properties due to the independent feature.
4, It would require an extensive effort to convert legacy it to microservices.
