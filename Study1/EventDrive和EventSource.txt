这里探讨 Event Driven 和 Event sourcing 的区别

Purpose:
Event sourcing is an alternative to traditional persistence strategies, with the purpose of keeping history.
Event driven architecture is a distributed asynchronous architecture pattern used to produce highly scalable applications.

Scope:
Event sourcing is usually applied in a single application/system, maybe implemented as services; however usually sharing the same storage.


Data storage:
Event sourcing has a central event store.
Event driven architecture distributed so each component (or event processors) is decoupled and most likely to have their own storage.


Testability
Event sourcing is somehow more easier to test because it focus on one main component, which contain the event source DB
And event driven need isolation testing
