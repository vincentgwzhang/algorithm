并行的好处
1, Running of multiple applications
2, Better resource utilization         ## It enables that the resources that are unused by one application can be used for other applications.
3, Better average response time        ## Without concurrency, each application has to be run to completion before the next one can be run.
4, Better performance

并行的坏处
